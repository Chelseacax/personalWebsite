summary: Hey, I'm Chelsea! Think of me as a cross between Bear Grylls, Elon Musk, and Marie Kondo. I adore scaling mountains and coding up life-changing apps, sometimes before lunch! I'm super interested in how design can be a Jedi mind trick to make us better humans. So if you love nature, tech, or just want to talk about how to make life more awesome, let's chat!

# Some sort of self-Introduction


## Hey there, Earthlings! 

I'm Chelsea, and I'm pretty much what you'd get if you mashed up Bear Grylls, Elon Musk, and Marie Kondo into one person. Picture this: one moment I'm scaling a mountain like it's a casual stroll in the park, and the next, I'm trying to create the ultimate life-hack app that not only solves your problems but also sparks joy!

Now, don't get me wrongâ€”I love the 'Great Indoors' too. By that, I mean the digital landscape where pixels and code are the trees and rivers. I'm passionate about using technology as my Swiss Army knife for tackling life's little (and big) challenges. And speaking of challenges, have you ever tried to find your tent in the dark? It's like a game of 'Where's Waldo,' but you're Waldo, and everything around you is also dressed in red and white stripes. But I digress.

Lately, I've been geeking out over the way design can Jedi-mind-trick us into becoming better humans. Like, what if a trash can could make you laugh so hard, you'd actually want to recycle? Or if your fitness app was so charming, you'd feel guilty not going for a jog? The force is strong with design, my friends, and I'm on a quest to harness it for the greater good.

So, if you want to exchange crazy hiking stories, debate whether design can save the world, or just want to ponder why smartphones still aren't smart enough to find themselves when they're lost, hit me up! Let's make this journey called life a bit more fun, functional, and fabulous!
